/**
 * Create a FreeRTOS task with its stack in PSRAM and TCB in internal RAM.
 *
 * This saves internal SRAM (~290 KB total, shared with Wi-Fi/BLE DMA buffers)
 * by moving the stack to the 8 MB PSRAM.  Requires
 * CONFIG_FREERTOS_TASK_CREATE_ALLOW_EXT_MEM=y (already enabled).
 *
 * The StaticTask_t (TCB, ~92 bytes) stays in internal RAM (FreeRTOS
 * requirement).  The stack is allocated with MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM.
 *
 * For self-deleting tasks: if out_stack and out_tcb are NULL (default),
 * the task is automatically tracked and its stack and TCB are reaped
 * once the task has exited and been processed by the FreeRTOS idle task.
 * Alternatively, pass non-NULL pointers to manage memory explicitly.
 *
 * @param task_func   Task function
 * @param name        FreeRTOS task name
 * @param stack_size  Stack size in bytes
 * @param arg         Task argument
 * @param priority    Task priority
 * @param core_id     Core affinity (0, 1, or tskNO_AFFINITY)
 * @param out_stack   If non-NULL, receives the PSRAM stack pointer (caller frees).
 *                    If NULL, memory is automatically reclaimed upon task exit.
 * @param out_tcb     If non-NULL, receives the internal TCB pointer (caller frees).
 *                    If NULL, memory is automatically reclaimed upon task exit.
 * @return Task handle, or NULL on failure
